          JavaScript was designed by Brendan Eich. First appeared 12/4/1995.
          Netscape Communications recruited Eich with the goal of embedding
          the Scheme programming language into its Netscape Navigator. Before he
          could get started, Netscape Communications collaborated with Sun
          Microsystems to include in Netscape Navigator Sun&apos;s more static
          programming language Java, in tries to compete with Microsoft for user
          adoption of Web technologies and platforms. Netscape Communications
          then decided that the scripting language they wanted to create would
          complement Java and should have a similar syntax, which excluded
          adopting other languages such as Perl, Python, TCL, or Scheme. To
          defend the idea of JavaScript against competing proposals, the company
          needed a prototype. Eich wrote one in 10 days, in May 1995. JavaScript
          is a high-level, dynamic, weakly typed, object-based, multi-paradigm
          language, supports event-driven, functional, and imperative
          and prototype-based) programming styles.
